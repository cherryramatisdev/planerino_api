# Planerino API

Original Reference: <https://planerino.fly.dev>

## Why I'm backing away from monolith?
`Planerino` is a project for me to learn above all things, so I'm splitting into an API with multiple frontends so I can apply more knowledge.

**Goals**

1. Define a more backend centric architecture(based on DDD)
2. Write as much tests as possible (both unit and integration)
3. Become more skillable in rails for APIs.

**Goals that I'll achieve with this project**

1. Write frontend in elm to learn more about functional programming.
2. Write a discord bot to register and query debits.
3. (Possibly) Write a telegram bot for alerts and stuff.
